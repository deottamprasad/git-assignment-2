Using git reset to Unstage
We can use git reset to unstage changes.

$ git reset myFile.txt
this makes sure the file is NOT included in our next commit. The local changes themselves are not affected by this command.

Unstaging All Files at Once
Sometimes, we might want to unstage all of the files we had already added to the Staging Area. In such a situation, we can use git reset without further options:

$ git reset
The Staging Area will be emptied (but our local changes themselves are left untouched).
